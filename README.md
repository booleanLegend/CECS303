# CECS303
Networks and Network Security with Oscar Samayoa

This repo includes all slides, labs, and the semester project conducted throughout the first course with Professor Samayoa in Spring 2022. By far, my favorite course in CSULB. I got almost 100% in the labs. (Unfortunately, I am not able to upload the VM's themselves to GitHub). The slides cover exactly everything that would be in the midterm and the final. Study them well. Labs are also fair game on the tests. The tests are tricky but not overwhelming. The semester project was also a big chunk of the grade, but was broad as far as any prompt goes. Enjoy my favorite course at CSULB as well as my favorite professor. Do not hesitate to ask him any questions, whether that is regarding life, the course, careers, jobs, etc... He is very open to anything.

NOTE: I suggest you do the course without external help as this will help you to understand the fundamentals as well as allow for practice. You will learn in this course and have fun.
